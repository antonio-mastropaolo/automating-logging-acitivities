We started by discussing the limitations of LANCE \cite{mastropaolo2022using}, the state-of-the-art approach for the generation of complete log statements. LANCE always assumes that a \emph{single} log statement \emph{must} be injected in a method provided as input. This is a strong assumption considering that a method may not need logging or may need more than one log statement. Thus, we presented \approach, an extension of LANCE able to partially address these two limitations, making a further step ahed in the automation of logging activities. Also, we experimented in \approach a combination of DL and IR with the goal of improving the generation of meaningful log messages achieving, however, only limited improvements over LANCE

We are working on the implementation of \approach as a tool to be deployed to developers. This is the next step needed to perform \emph{in vivo} studies, thus better understanding the main weaknesses of current DL-based log generation.
